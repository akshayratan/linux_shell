linux_shell
===========
This is a IT project in my 4th semester in which I have authored tsh.c.

Basically, a shell is made which has few buit-in commands like quit, jobs etc. You can run traces by the command~~~

make test01
make test02

and so on ! 

Please see README.txt file in the repository for more information.
